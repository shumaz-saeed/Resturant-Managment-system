## üóÑÔ∏è Database Structure

Our system uses a simple yet effective SQLite database (`restaurant.db`) with three tables:

  * **`workers`**:

      * `id`: Unique identifier for each worker.
      * `name`: Worker's full name.
      * `role`: Worker's job role (e.g., "Waiter", "Chef").

  * **`orders`**:

      * `id`: Unique identifier for each order.
      * `table_number`: The table number for dine-in orders (0 for takeaway).
      * `items`: A list of all items ordered.
      * `total_price`: The total cost of the order.
      * `timestamp`: When the order was placed.

  * **`tables`**:

      * `number`: Unique table number.
      * `seats`: Number of seats available at the table.
      * `is_reserved`: Status of the table (0 = Free, 1 = Reserved).

## üìú Logs & Receipts

  * **`restaurant.log`**: A detailed log of all major activities, perfect for monitoring operations and troubleshooting.
  * **`receipt_table_[table_number].txt`**: Individual, human-readable receipts for each dine-in order.
